I am building a website called Riffmatwes meant to serve musicians and bands using Django.
The site need to achieve the following;
    profile pages for musicians
    Classified ad listings
    Annoucements listing for try outs.
    Search capabilities based on instruments played and style of music.
    Messaging between potential matches.
